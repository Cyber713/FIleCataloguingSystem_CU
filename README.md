#### Alternatively, you can run:
```
make install
```
(from the root of the project)

---

### Main Entry Point
- The main file is [`main.py`](src/main.py)

### Database Logic & Utilities
- Refer to [`units.py`](src/units.py)

### Unit Tests
- Refer to [`unit_tests.py`](src/unit_tests.py)

## Usage Guide

### Configuration

Before running the program, configure the [`configuration.json`](src/configuration.json) file with the following structure:  
![Config Example](/assets/documentation/config_example_1.png)

The `password` field is optional:  
![Config Example with Pass](/assets/documentation/config_example_with_password.png)

The example `configuration.json`:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3306,
  "database": "File_Management",
  "user": "root"
}
```

---

### Launching the App

- Run `main.py` and wait a few seconds for the Flet GUI to render.
- Depending on your configuration, one of the following screens may appear:

1. **Wrong Credentials or Missing MySQL**  
   ![Password Error Screen](assets/documentation/password_error.png)  
   Appears if the structure is valid but credentials are incorrect, or if MySQL is not installed/initialized.

2. **Invalid JSON Structure**  
   ![Configuration file contains errors](assets/documentation/config_error.png)  
   Ensure the configuration contains only a single valid JSON object.

3. **Valid Configuration Without Password**  
   ![Configuration file configured](assets/documentation/config_configured.png)

4. **Auto-Login via Password in Config**  
   ![Configuration with autologin](assets/documentation/auto_log_on_config.png)  
   If the password is provided and correct, the app launches without prompting for login.

### Handling Errors After Launch

If an error occurs after the app starts (e.g., config error, DB connection failure, incorrect password):

- **Do not restart the app.** Fix the issue, then use these buttons:
  - Refresh the app:  
    ![Refresh](assets/documentation/refresh.png)
  - Re-enter password:  
    ![Password Prompt](assets/documentation/password_prompt.png)
